# WeathersmithFX

## This project is a WIP and relies on an instance of <a href="https://github.com/phydesmith/GeosmithAPI">GeosmithAPI</a> running on the same LAN.

This is a JavaFX weather app. You enter in the zip code, which resolves against the previously mentioned GeosmithAPI for geo-points. These are then sent to the weather.gov API and the current forecast is retrieved.
